<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hello everyone, I'm Garlic mc I've been playing Minecraft for more than 2 years and I feel really like this game from its gameplay and graphics, although I've only played for more than 2 years, but in the process I have learned a lot about this game and I have understood somewhat about the history of its formation as well as the youtube that has in this game, some of whom are still considered legends of Minecraft. Now, after a period of togetherness, I have decided to set up a YouTube channel to post videos of me playing Minecraft partly for entertainment, partly for entertainment, maybe it will be my memory in the future with this game. But no matter what, I still hope to be loved and supported by everyone, if you have any opinions, please leave them in the comments, I will consider and improve myself :33</p>
